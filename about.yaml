  Our project simulates the management of a restaurant through an interactive
  game. The terminal shows a mock restaurant set-up made up of lines and different
  symbols, and the player is able to perform different roles in the restaraunt such
  as managing a waitlist, placing a group at a table, serving the customers,
  cleaning the table, etc. Input is taken in from the terminal, and each
  specified input will perform an action inside of the game. Our code is also
  be able to compute if there exists a potential rearrangement of tables and
  groups to accommodate for the user and its party for waitlisting. Every few
  seconds, an updated visualization will be displayed and the user will be able
  to repeat the process until the game is over. We are able to keep track of
  the score based on time taken and other satisfaction factors, displaying
  these on the end screen once the game ends.
